# 📊 Product Management Case Study: Store Performance Dashboard – Blinkit

This project is a data-driven dashboard designed to help Blinkit Store Managers and Ops teams track and improve store-level operational KPIs.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Blinkit's store managers lacked a unified and actionable view of operational performance metrics such as True Fill Rate (TFR), GRN < 6 Hours, and PPI Multiplier. Existing dashboards were fragmented, lacked real-time clarity, and didn’t flag issues or bonus/penalty triggers, making it hard to take timely actions.

## 👤 Target Users

- 🧑‍💼 Store Managers
- 📦 Assistant Store Managers
- 📊 Cluster/City Ops Heads

## 🎯 Goals (KPIs Tracked)

| KPI               | Goal        |
|------------------|-------------|
| True Fill Rate    | > 95%       |
| GRN < 6hr         | > 90%       |
| Direct Handover % | > 85%       |
| PPI Multiplier    | > 0.85      |
| Open Variance     | < -0.03     |
| Bonus/Penalty     | Auto-flagged|
